      <h2>Graduate Information Technology and Web Science Program</h2>
      <p>
        Interdisciplinary From Day One. In a world in which information
        technology affects virtually everything we do, there is a demand for an
        academic program that offers students the deepest understanding of the
        Web. As an ITWS student, you will investigate issues related to
        security, trust, privacy, content value, and the development of the Web
        in the future.

      <h2>Ph.D. in Multidisciplinary Science</h2>
      <p>
        Ph.D. programs in Architecture, Engineering, Humanities and Social
        Sciences, Management, and Science offer a wealth of opportunities for
        doctoral study with focused IT research.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, for highly interdisciplinary research, an IT Track is
        available in the Multidisciplinary Science Ph.D. program. The IT Track
        is designed to allow a student to work with faculty from multiple
        Rensselaer departments and schools.
      </p>

      <h3>Information Technology Track</h3>
      <p>
        The IT Track in the Multidisciplinary Science PhD program is designed to
        prepare students for a career in interdisciplinary IT research. The IT
        Track requires a technical core coupled with a concentration that
        provides the context for the student's research. This concentration may
        incorporate one or more disciplines in addition to its core IT
        components. The IT Track focuses on research â€“ creative and original
        enough to be recognized by scholars in the student's areas of
        concentration, both in academia and industry.
