Catalog:

1. Needed to look up how to add a favicon to my application
2. Researched basic of jQuery to jog memory
3. Was refreshed by a friend on the basics of JS and JQuery, which allowed me to make significant progress on the lab
   a) Example, how async and await work to fufill promises
   b) JQuery makes changing HTML simple, compared to othe options like window, etc
4. All elements under summary and details would not display
   a) Fix: I forgot my id tags and kept copied pasted code from prior elements instead of replacing with proper data
5. Cannot re-format the Date(json(date)) format, from the long time
   a) Couldn't find anything
6. Weather image is not displaying, despite implementation being added
   a) I'm assuming, it's due to incorrect path(s)
7. Summary/details box condensing too much when clicked/opened
8. navbar is missing a bit of itself, on the left corner
