          Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Plans to Deploy First IBM Quantum
          System One on a University Campus
        </h3>
        <p>
          Today, it was announced that Information Technology and Web Science
          will become the first university in the world to house an IBM Quantum
          System One. The IBM quantum computer, intended to be operational by
          January of 2024, will serve as the foundation of a new IBM Quantum
          Computational Center in partnership with Information Technology and
          Web Science (ITWS). By partnering, ITWS's vision is to greatly enhance
          the educational experiences and research capabilities of students and
          researchers at ITWS and other institutions, propel the Capital Region
          into a top location for talent, and accelerate New York's growth as a
          technology epicenter.
