      <h2>Undergraduate Information Technology and Web Science Program</h2>
      <p>
        Interdisciplinary From Day One. In a world in which information
        technology affects virtually everything we do, there is a demand for an
        academic program that offers students the deepest understanding of the
        Web. As an ITWS student, you will investigate issues related to
        security, trust, privacy, content value, and the development of the Web
        in the future.

      <h2>About the Program</h2>
      <p>
        You will take a core set of courses on Web and IT development and
        management, along with courses in your focus track, selected from more
        than 20 options, including arts, engineering, management,
        communications, artificial intelligence, Web systems, and medicine.

      <h2>Curriculum</h2>
      <p>
        Completion of the B.S. in Information Technology and Web Science
        requires a total of 128 - 130 credit hours:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ITWS Core Requirements (24 - 26 credits)</li>
        <li>Focus Track Requirement (44 credits)</li>
        <li>Rensselaer Degree Requirements (60 credits)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The ITWS core requirements establish a solid foundation for applying
        ITWS to any discipline. The required focus track provides an opportunity
        for in-depth study of an ITWS application area. Focus track options
        include arts, communication and networks, law, management information
        systems, medicine, psychology, and numerous others. In consultation with
        a faculty adviser, students may also design their own focus track
        through the selection of courses that match their individual interests.
        The Rensselaer requirements ensure the degreeâ€™s breadth and its
        consistency with long-established Rensselaer traditions.
